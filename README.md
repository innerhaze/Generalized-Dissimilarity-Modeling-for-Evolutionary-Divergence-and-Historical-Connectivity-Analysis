# Generalized-Dissimilarity-Modeling-for-Evolutionary-Divergence-and-Historical-Connectivity-Analysis
This repository contains R scripts for analyzing the relationship between evolutionary divergence and historical connectivity in Andean páramos. Using GDM, NMDS, and evolutionary distance data, the project explores how Pleistocene climatic fluctuations influenced diversification in páramo species.
